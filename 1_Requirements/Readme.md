# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

**Owners of small shops in general can use this application to organize and easily access their stock**

## What:

**Companies often use inventory management software to reduce their carrying costs. The software is used to track products and parts as they are transported from a vendor to a warehouse, between warehouses, and finally to a retail location or directly to a customer.**

## When:

**The stock management is a monotonous job to be done by people.This system can be employed when the stores need to reduce their number of employees and use them for better work**

## Where:

**It can be used in any retail/wholesale shop where the stocks have to be managed and total turnover can be identified easily using the program**

## How:

**The shop owner can update the data in the system when a new item arrives or when a new stock of the earlier item is renewed.And also the number of items sold has to be updated so as to keep the database updated**
